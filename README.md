# Sharif Haason @sharifhsn
I am a 22-year-old computer science graduate from Rutgers University - New Brunswick.

## Work Experience
Since the summer of 2021, I have interned at Rutgers Newark SASN-IT as a developer. I document software, create utilities, and generally learn to understand the [Rutgers Newark website](https://sasn.rutgers.edu/) from a full-stack web developer perspective. I have also designed a web app through the Power Apps platform for SharePoint.

## Programming Experience
I have been coding since I was a freshman in university in 2019. Through university education I learned both Java and C. For personal projects, I learned Python in 2020, which is the language I am most comfortable coding in. I used PHP, JavaScript, and Python through my internship at Rutgers University. The largest personal project that I have built is an emulator for the CHIP-8 system written in Python, linked [here](https://github.com/sharifhsn/chip8-python-testing).

I also use Rust as a hobby language, and contribute to open source Rust projects. My most notable contributions are to [hexyl](https://github.com/sharkdp/hexyl), a command-line hex viewer.

## Hobbies
Besides coding, I enjoy reading books in my spare time. Some of my favorites are Gone with the Wind, War and Peace, Kafka on the Shore, and Circe. I am pursuing an English major on top of my computer science major.

I also love playing video games on my Nintendo Switch, playing pickup basketball, and keeping up with current events.

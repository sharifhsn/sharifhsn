# Sharif Haason @sharifhsn
I am a 23-year-old master's in financial engineering student at Stevens Institute of Technology.

## About Me

I'm a software engineer with a passion for **Rust**, infrastructure, and politics.

I've been following Rust since 2021 and am actively working to improve its place in the quantitative finance ecosystem.

From years of development, I have refined a strong problem-solving attitude and knowledge base for all kinds of computer infrastructure, making me very competent at basic and advanced IT tasks.

I am always following current events and markets, and I love to dive deep into the macro view of an issue.

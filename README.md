# Sharif Haason @sharifhsn
I am a 22-year-old master's in financial engineering student at Stevens Institute of Technology.

## Education
I graduated in 2024 from Rutgers University - New Brunswick with a bachelor's degree in computer science. I started my MFE in September 2024, and I've been studying topics like risk management, derivatives pricing (equity and fixed-income), and numerical computational methods for financial products.

## Work Experience
At Stevens, I work as a lab assistant at the Hanlon Financial Lab. My primary responsibility is managing virtual machine access to our H100 GPUs. In addition, I have set up different Google Apps scripts for automating resource request management from faculty and staff. While at the lab, I provide technical support to students and faculty for our Bloomberg Terminals and podium software.

From 2023 to 2024, I worked with a cloud security company Cloudnosys, developing JavaScript security controls for AWS accounts as part of their auditing platform.

From 2021 to 2023, I interned at Rutgers Newark SASN-IT as a developer. I documented software, created utilities, and generally learn to understand the [Rutgers Newark website](https://sasn.rutgers.edu/) from a full-stack web developer perspective. My major project was a web app through the Power Apps platform that digitized the process for adding or modifying courses.

## Programming Experience
I have been coding since I was a freshman in university in 2019. Through university education I learned both Java and C. For personal projects, I learned Python in 2020, which is the language I am most comfortable coding in. I used PHP, JavaScript, and Python through my internship at Rutgers University. I used JavaScript at Cloudnosys. At Stevens, I primarily use Python and Rust, with some R.

I also use Rust as a hobby language, and am very passionate about it. I have contributed to open source Rust projects. My most notable contributions are to [hexyl](https://github.com/sharkdp/hexyl), a command-line hex viewer.

## Hobbies
Besides coding, I enjoy reading books in my spare time. Some of my favorites are Gone with the Wind, War and Peace, Kafka on the Shore, and Circe.

I also love playing video games on my Nintendo Switch, playing pickup basketball, and keeping up with current events.
